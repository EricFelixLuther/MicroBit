A little project of simple games for my little daughter Lucy. It requires a WaveShare joystick module.

It consists of three games:

* On shaking, it starts to randomize a standard six-sided dice. After few seconds it stops randomizing, plays a tune and flashes final result.
* On clicking A button, switches to A game. It really just displays what just was pressed, with directional arrows on analog press and smiley faces on other buttons. Plays a tune on each button.
* On clicking B button, switches to B game.
